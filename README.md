- "is used for server-side programming, and primarily deployed for non-blocking, event-driven servers, such as traditional web sites and back-end API services"
- we will be using react native, which is a Javascript framework for developing mobile applications
- run "Node -v" for those of you who already have to ensure it is not too outdated
- installation includes npm

In your terminal try: "sudo npm i -g expo-cli" or "npm i -g expo-cli"

- The Expo CLI is a command-line tool that is the primary interface between a developer and other Expo tools.

Install "Expo Go" on your mobile device:

- Expo Go is a free, open-source sandbox for learning and experimenting with React Native on Android and iOS devices.

Optionally (recommended) install React Native Tools in Extensions of VSCode

- This VS Code extension provides a development environment for React Native projects. Using this extension, you can debug your code and quickly run react-native commands from the command palette.

Optionally install ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native snippets in extensions

Optionally install Prettier in extensions

Optionally install Material Icon Theme

In terminal: type "expo init SOME_NAME"

- Expo is a framework that is used to build React Native apps. It is basically a bundle with tools and services built for React Native, that will help you get started with building React Native apps with ease.
- A “managed workflow” is when you let Expo handle specifying important properties through a convenient app.json, as well build your app on their servers. A “bare workflow” is when you’re not solely restricted to the “Expo ecosystem,” and thus are free to do more customization to your app.
- We will proceed with bare workflow

Navigate to your SOME_NAME dir and type "npm start"
